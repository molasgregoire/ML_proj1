## run.py

### this file contains the final code to perform our prediction. It is divided into several cells.
### The first one import library and function from other files. The second one load the datasets, both for training and testing, and then apply our data processing on both. The third one is the model testing, where cross validation (10 groups) using stochastic logistic regression function is performed. The next cell generates a prediction for the test set in csv format. The last cell performs the prediction on the train set to have an estimation of the accuracy of the model before evaluating the predictions on test.
### Before running it, make sure your path to the datasets is correct and that both datasets are unzipped into csv format.
### Run the whole file to reproduce the predictions.
